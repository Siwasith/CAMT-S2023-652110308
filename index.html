    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>PlayStation was the brainchild of Ken Kutaragi,
        a Sony executive who managed one of the 
        company's hardware engineering divisions 
        and was later dubbed "The Father of the PlayStation".
        Until 1991, Sony had little direct involvement with
         the video game industry. The company supplied components
        for other consoles, such as the sound chip for the Super
        Famicom from Nintendo, and operated a video game studio,
        Sony Imagesoft.[20] As part of a joint project between
        Nintendo and Sony that began as early as 1988, the two
        companies worked to create a CD-ROM version of the Super
        Famicom, though Nintendo denied the existence of the Sony deal
        as late as March 1991.[22] At the Consumer Electronics Show in
        June 1991, Sony revealed a Super Famicom with a built-in CD-ROM drive
        that incorporated Green Book technology or CD-i, called "Play Station"
        (also known as SNES-CD). However, a day after the announcement at CES,
        Nintendo announced that it would be breaking its partnership with Sony,
        opting to go with Philips instead but using the same technology.[23]
        The deal was broken by Nintendo after they were unable to come to an
        agreement on how revenue would be split between the two companies.[23]
        The breaking of the partnership infuriated Sony President Norio Ohga,
        who responded by appointing Kutaragi with the responsibility of 
        developing the PlayStation project to rival Nintendo.</p><br>
